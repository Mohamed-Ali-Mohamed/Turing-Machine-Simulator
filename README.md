# Turing-Machine-Simulator
Build a STTM to:-
1) L= {w | w is palindrome | w ∈ {0,1}*}.
2) L= {ww | w ∈ {a,b}^+}.
3) L= {a^i b^j c^k | i*j=k | i,j,k≥1}.
4) L= {0^2^n | n ≥ 0}.
5) Add 3 to a binary number.
6) Convert from unary to binary.
7) Convert from binary to unary.
8) Unary multiplication.
and simulate graphically what happen when input is entered.
